Sure, here's a structured explanation of the control flow for different modes in the test program:

### Control Flow for Different Modes

#### Mode 1: Serial Single File
1. **Initialization**:
   - Process 0 gathers data from all processes using `MPI_Gather`.
2. **File Operations**:
   - Process 0 opens the file using `MPI_File_open`.
   - Process 0 writes the gathered data to the file using `MPI_File_write`.
   - Process 0 closes the file if it's the last loop iteration.
3. **Request Handling**:
   - Set `request` to `MPI_REQUEST_NULL`.

#### Mode 2: Sync Parallel with Shared File Pointer and Explicit Offset
1. **Initialization**:
   - Each process calculates its offset in the file.
2. **File Operations**:
   - Each process opens the file using `MPI_File_open`.
   - Each process writes its data to the file at the calculated offset using `MPI_File_write_at`.
   - Each process closes the file if it's the last loop iteration.
3. **Request Handling**:
   - Set `request` to `MPI_REQUEST_NULL`.

#### Mode 3: Sync Collective with Shared File Pointer
1. **Initialization**:
   - Process 0 broadcasts the result array to all processes using `MPI_Bcast`.
2. **File Operations**:
   - All processes collectively open the file using `MPI_File_open`.
   - All processes collectively write their data to the file using `MPI_File_write_all`.
   - All processes collectively close the file if it's the last loop iteration.
3. **Request Handling**:
   - Set `request` to `MPI_REQUEST_NULL`.

#### Mode 4: Sync Parallel with Independent Files
1. **File Operations**:
   - Each process opens its own file using `MPI_File_open`.
   - Each process writes its data to its own file using `MPI_File_write`.
   - Each process closes its file if it's the last loop iteration.
2. **Request Handling**:
   - Set `request` to `MPI_REQUEST_NULL`.

#### Mode 5: Async Parallel with Shared File Pointer and Explicit Offset
1. **Initialization**:
   - Each process calculates its offset in the file.
2. **File Operations**:
   - Each process opens the file using `MPI_File_open`.
   - Each process initiates a non-blocking write to the file at the calculated offset using `MPI_File_iwrite_at`.
3. **Request Handling**:
   - The `request` is set to the non-blocking write request.

#### Mode 6: Async Collective with Shared File Pointer
1. **Initialization**:
   - Process 0 gathers data from all processes using `MPI_Gather`.
   - Process 0 broadcasts the result array to all processes using `MPI_Bcast`.
2. **File Operations**:
   - All processes collectively open the file using `MPI_File_open`.
   - All processes collectively initiate a non-blocking write to the file using `MPI_File_iwrite_all`.
3. **Request Handling**:
   - The `request` is set to the non-blocking write request.

#### Mode 7: Async Parallel with Independent Files
1. **File Operations**:
   - Each process opens its own file using `MPI_File_open`.
   - Each process initiates a non-blocking write to its own file using `MPI_File_iwrite`.
2. **Request Handling**:
   - The `request` is set to the non-blocking write request.

#### Mode 8: Collective with Selective Ranks
1. **Initialization**:
   - Process 0 broadcasts the result array to all processes using `MPI_Bcast`.
2. **File Operations**:
   - Selected processes collectively open the file using `MPI_File_open`.
   - Selected processes collectively write their data to the file using `MPI_File_write_all`.
   - Selected processes collectively close the file if it's the last loop iteration.
3. **Request Handling**:
   - Set `request` to `MPI_REQUEST_NULL`.

#### Mode 9: Async Collective with Selective Ranks
1. **Initialization**:
   - Process 0 gathers data from all processes using `MPI_Gather`.
   - Process 0 broadcasts the result array to all processes using `MPI_Bcast`.
2. **File Operations**:
   - Selected processes collectively open the file using `MPI_File_open`.
   - Selected processes collectively initiate a non-blocking write to the file using `MPI_File_iwrite_all`.
3. **Request Handling**:
   - The `request` is set to the non-blocking write request.

### General Flow
1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize MPI and set up variables.
   - Allocate memory for result arrays.
   - Gather and scatter data among processes.
2. **Main Loop**:
   - Perform computations.
   - Perform I/O operations based on the selected mode.
3. **Finalization**:
   - Wait for the last I/O operation to complete.
   - Close the file if necessary.
   - Read data back from the file.
   - Print elapsed time and finalize MPI.
